    "description": "Doors 6:30pm. Show 7:30pm With his rich baritone voice and his mastery of the deepest traditions of soul, jazz and gospel, Gregory Porter has established himself as one of America's most versatile and acclaimed vocalists. His artistry and sensitivity is plain to the ear whether he's putting his stamp on beloved standards by heroes like Nat \"King\" Cole or demonstrating his own writing talents with original songs strong enough to stand with the many classics in his repertoire. Produced by Troy Miller (Jamie Cullum, Laura Mvula), All Rise is Porter's sixth studio album and fourth for the iconic Blue Note label. Like his 2013 breakthrough Liquid Spirit - the Grammy Award winner for Best Jazz Vocal Album - Porter's latest is a confident display of his many gifts, starting with his ability to convey feelings of both exaltation and sadness with uncommon directness and warmth.",

    "description": "Join us at the Carolina Theatre as the Levine Museum of the New South hosts a live recording of its award-winning podcast, Our New South, featuring Doug Jones, former U.S. Senator from Alabama. From the courtroom to the Capitol, Jones has spent his career standing up for justice and bridging divides. As the federal prosecutor who brought long-overdue accountability to the Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and later as a senator representing Alabama, Jones has remained guided by integrity, empathy and a deep belief in doing what?s right. Hosted by journalist and Washington Post columnist Kevin Blackistone and historian Dr. Robert Greene II, Our New South sparks conversations about the people, places and ideas shaping the region today. In this special live episode, Jones will reflect on his journey and share what the New South means to him and the future he envisions for the region.",
