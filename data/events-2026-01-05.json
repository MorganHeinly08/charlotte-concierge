Set in a small Southern city, The ChangeBaker follows the story of Manolo Betancur, whose bakery in North Carolina became a sanctuary for immigrants and a frontline in the battle for justice following a series of ICE raids. What began as a pursuit of the American Dream transformed into something much greater: a hub of resilience, purpose, and activism. From Soldier to Bread Hero: Manolo arrived in the U.S. with a dream after fleeing the violence of war in Colombia. Today, he is the proud owner of the first Latin bakery in his city and the recipient of the World Bread Hero Award. His story is a tribute to those who rise before dawn to build a better nation, often unseen and uncelebrated. At the heart of the film is a simple but powerful message: Made in America by Immigrant Hands.",
